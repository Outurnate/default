This project is a starting point for all my CMake based projects.  It provides stand gnu-style building as well as integration with emacs

Adding project to EDE
---------------------

Add this to your .emacs

    (when (file-exists-p "ROOT_PROJECT_DIR/CMakeLists.txt")
      (load-path "ROOT_PROJECT_DIR/tools/emacs/project.el"))
